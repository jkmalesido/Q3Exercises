			<h3>HTML</h3>
			<p>HyperText Markup Language</p>
			<p>HTML is like the skeletal framework of a human body, and the content is the organs. Its technical definition is that it describes the content and forms the structure of your webpage. Similar to the skeleton of a human body, it houses and shields our organs from external harm.</p>

		<div class="col-sm-4">
			<h3>CSS</h3>
			<p>Cascading Style Sheets</p>
			<p>CSS is like putting on accessories on your outfit. Aside from wearing only your dress or your suit, you add jewelry, make-up, head accessories, and many more to enhance your outfit. CSS accessorizes your HTML files by adding properties such as color, decoration, transformation, borders, and others.</p>

		<div class="col-sm-4">
			<h3>Bootstrap</h3>
			<p>Bootstrap Version 4</p>
			<p>Unlike HTML and CSS, Bootstrap can be used for all devices. Since it is easily convenient for all devices, Bootstrap can adjust the display of your webpage from the smallest to the biggest screens. Its main purpose is for mobile-convenience, due to the rapid spread of mobile devices.</p>
